            <h2>1. Non-Affiliation and Official Source Disclosure</h2>
            <p>This mobile application (the "App") is an independent tool developed for the convenience of industry professionals. This App is NOT affiliated with, endorsed by, authorized by, or in any way officially connected to the United States Department of Labor (DOL), the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates.</p>
            <p>The "SLAM" acronym (Stop, Look, Analyze, Manage) and the associated risk assessment methodology are public domain safety protocols established by MSHA. The official physical "SLAM Risks" booklet is available for purchase through the MSHA/Joseph A. Holmes Safety Association. This App serves as a digital interface for that publicly available methodology and does not represent a government entity.</p>
            
            <h2>2. Intellectual Property & Trademark Notice</h2>
            <p>The "SLAM RISKS" name, concept, and the "fist" graphic are intellectual property created by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) and MSHA. All product names, logos, and brands are property of their respective owners. The use of the SLAM methodology within this App is intended for safety training and compliance assistance purposes.</p>
            
            <h2>3. Data Privacy and User-Generated Content</h2>
            <p>The Developer of this App prioritizes user privacy and data sovereignty. Regarding all user-generated content, including but not limited to, photographs taken within the App, site descriptions, and exported PDF reports:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Local Storage Only:</strong> All data and images captured within the App are stored locally on the User’s mobile device. The Developer does not maintain, access, or own any external servers for the storage or transmission of your data.</li>
                <li><strong>Third-Party Backup Responsibility:</strong> The User acknowledges that modern mobile operating systems (e.g., Android/Google or iOS/Apple) may automatically back up device data, including App folders and photo galleries, to third-party cloud services (such as Google Drive, Google Photos, or iCloud). <span style="color: #c0392b;">The User is solely responsible for managing their device’s backup settings.</span> Any data, images, or documents that are knowingly or mistakenly backed up, synced, or copied to any external storage or server via the device's operating system or other third-party applications are the sole responsibility of the User. The Developer shall not be held liable for any data breaches or privacy issues occurring on these third-party platforms.</li>
                <li><strong>User-Initiated Distribution:</strong> The transmission of PDF reports and images is strictly at the discretion and initiation of the User (e.g., via the User's own email client or third-party file-sharing services).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>4. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>This App is provided "as-is" for informational and organizational purposes. While it is designed to mirror official safety protocols, the User and the Mine Operator remain solely responsible for ensuring that all safety assessments meet the specific regulatory requirements and any other applicable laws. The Developer shall not be held liable for any accidents, injuries, or regulatory fines resulting from the use or misuse of this digital tool.</p>
            
            <h2>5. Image Attribution & Usage</h2>
            <p>The "SLAM RISKS" emblem (featuring the "fist" graphic and "STOP LOOK ANALYZE MANAGE" text) used within this application is a reproduction of the official artwork provided by the U.S. Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration.</p>
            <p>Full credit for the design and original creation of this safety mark is given to the U.S. Department of Labor. Its inclusion in this App is intended to maintain consistency with the official 2004 AD safety initiative and to ensure miners recognize the standard safety protocols being followed.</p>
